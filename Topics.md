## Overview
With this 4.x release topic levels have been refactored for consistency using the following general format
```
ring/<location_id>/<ring_category>/<device_id>/<device_type>/state
ring/<location_id>/<ring_category>/<device_id>/<device_type>/command
```

The <ring_category> is either "alarm", "smart_lighting", "camera", or "chime" based on the type of device.  Cameras are doorbells, stickup, spotlight or floodlight cams.  Alarm devices are any devices connected via the Alarm base station and smart_lighting is any device connected via the smart lighting bridge.

The script monitors hub based devices (alarm and smart lighting) via the websocket connection and uses the automatic 20 status second polling to keep a heartbeat for polled devices (cameras and chimes), automatically updating the online/offline state of the devices based on this connectivity information.  As this is device level connectivity is published to "status" at the device_id level:
```
ring/<location_id>/<product_category>/<device_id>/status
```

Each device also inlcudes an "info" sensor where the state topic includes various supplemental data for the device in JSON format.  This available information varies by device type and includes data such as battery level, tamper status, communication state, volume, wifi signal strength, and other device specific data.  Recent version also include separate attribute sensors for battery, tamper and wifi status.

For the individual device capabilities the state and command messages are simple text based values (not JSON), which use the default values for the equivalent Home Assistant device integration.  Some sensors may have multiple attributes, such as a multi-level-switch with both on/off and brightness, so they will have a standard state/command topic and an additional topic in the format of <attribute>_state and <attribute>_topic.  Below is a listing of all currently supported devices and topics.
